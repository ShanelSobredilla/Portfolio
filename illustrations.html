      <h1 class="dadaism-item__title">Dadaism</h1>
      <p class="dadaism-item__description">Dadaism is one of the biggest art movement in art history. For this illustration, I wanted to find similarities between the art movement and a Swiss style artist. I wanted it to have a connection so I chose the German graphic designer/typographer, Wolfgang Weingart. <br>

        <br>DADA and Wolfgang are similar in a way that they both ‘rejected’ reason and rationality. DADA is a anti-art movement while Wolfgang wanted to breathe life into Swiss style. The typeface I chose is very straightforward but the letters are arranged with not much sense. I tried to give the overall look a “postwar” feel. I settled for a simpler look because I liked the irony of DADA being simplified from its complex form.</p>

      <h1 class="sur-item__title">Surrealism</h1>
      <p class="sur-item__description">Personally, I find surrealism such a fun and freeing art movement. Swiss graphic designer, Armin Hofmann was the artist I was inspired by for the Surrealist poster. The illustration behind it is representing a person’s face showing a contented look as if it was in a dream. The yellow ‘light’ is symbolizing the exploration of the mind’s unconscious state - which came from the popular freudian theory "Psychoanalysis".<br>

        <br>If you look closely, the eyes in the illustration is Dali's mustache ;)</p>

      <p class="mag-item__description">This illustration is made from real life images. I gave this a daydreaming retro vibe that was inspired by retro pop magazines. For this stlye, typeface is very important as it is in actual magazines so I had to be careful in choosing the fonts.</p>

      <p class="ab-item__description">I had a lot of fun making this poster especially since Manila is my hometown. I don't often visit the Philippines so for this project, I created a survey for Filipinos to answer. The entirety of the poster is enough to describe what Manila is. The most crucial part of this project is to maintain the shape of the iconic absolut vodka bottle. This project is a celebration of Manila.</p>

      <p class="zoo-item__description">For this project, I was tasked to re-create a poster of an animated film and I chose Zootopia. The place zootopia in the film is a very colorful city. I wanted to move away from that vibe and create a more rustic modern style illustration to twist things up a little bit. This required choosing muted colors even for the characters. </p>
